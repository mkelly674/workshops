## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/becloudready/workshops.git
cd workshops/fullstack-aws
```

Prerequisites: AWS account (free tier works), AWS CLI, Terraform, Node.js 18+, Python 3.10+, Git.

Start at [Chapter 01](./chapters/01-vibe-coding/).

---

## Who This Is For

- Fresh graduates preparing for a first engineering role
- Developers stuck at tutorial level who haven't shipped a real deployed app
- Anyone using AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) who needs the engineering fundamentals employers expect
- Job seekers who want a portfolio project that runs in production, not localhost

---

## Resource Naming (required — read before you start)

Every AWS resource you create must start with:

```
student-<your-slug>-
```

Your slug is assigned by the cohort admin (e.g. `alice-johnson`). The IAM policy enforces this — resources outside your namespace will be denied.

Tag every resource:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `student` | your slug |
| `cohort` | your cohort name |

Terraform projects handle this automatically when you pass `student_name=<slug>`.

## Live Delivery

This curriculum is delivered as an instructor-led workshop by [beCloudReady](https://becloudready.com).

- **Format:** 1-week intensive, live sessions + async lab time
- **Stack:** per-student AWS sandbox with GitHub Copilot seats included
- **Outcome:** deployed portfolio project + CI/CD pipeline in production

## Sandbox Setup (Instructor / Admin)

The [`terraform-iam/`](./terraform-iam/) folder provisions per-student AWS sandboxes for live cohorts — IAM users, namespace-scoped managed policies, Terraform workspaces per batch.

See [`admin-walkthrough.md`](./admin-walkthrough.md) for the full cohort setup process.
